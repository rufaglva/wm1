   <h3>Some fun fact about myself</h3>
   <p> Here are some fun facts about me:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Multilingual Skills:</li>
    <p>I am proficient in 3 languages(azerbaijani, russian, english), and intermediate in 2 more languages(ukranian, turkish) which allows me to communicate effectively with a diverse range of people</p>
    <li>Continious Learning:</li>
    <p>I'm an avid reader, always seeking to expand my knowledge. Some of my favorite books include "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites", 1st Edition by Jon Duckett, which have had a profound impact on my approach to web development.</p>
    <li>Community Engagement:</li>
    <p>I dedicate a portion of my time to volunteering with Italian Embassy, where I've been able to use my professional skills to make a meaningful impact in the community.</p>
    <li>Environmental Stewardship:</li>
    <p>Sustainability is a cause close to my heart, and I actively seek ways to integrate eco-friendly practices into my professional work and personal life. I even have a start-up project about that which proceeded up to Final Round of international Competetition "Battle of Minds".</p>
